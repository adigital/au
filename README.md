au
==

A thin wrapper around [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) to make it easier to perform common audio manipulations like cutting to a specific number of beats at a set BPM, volume adjustments, joining files together, and converting between file formats or between mono and stereo.

Setup:

1. install ffmpeg
2. save this file as 'au' in your ~/bin folder
3. chmod the file to be executable:

         chmod u+x ~/bin/au

You're all set.
